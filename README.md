# Tutorial on Targeted Maximum Likelihood (TMLE) method for causal inference # 

This paper was written by Elena Petridou, Valérie Valckx & Victoria Zillo as part of the course Causal Inference 2 at Leiden University. 

The tutorial explores what targeted maximum likelihood is, what the benefits of this method are, and shows an application of it on a simulated dataset based on the one studied in Noll et al. (2025)*. 

The code used in the tutorial is contained inline within the PDF document.
